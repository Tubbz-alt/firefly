## Firefly - Go Ethereum 2.0

This repository is an experimental work towards a Go implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 protocol. The rationale behind the separate repo is to permit cowboy coding, prototyping and experimenting without the strict security requirements of the Go Ethereum codebase. The eventual end goal is to merge this work upstream into [ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) once it's stable (whenever that might happen). Until then, consider any code in this repository unstable, unworkable, unsecure, unreliable and any other un-bad-thing.
